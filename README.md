# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development. 

Requirement analysis is the critical first phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC), where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, documented, and analyzed. This ensures that the final product aligns with user goals and business objectives.

In this repository, we will:
- Define types of requirements (functional, non-functional, technical)
- Explore tools and techniques for gathering requirements
- Document best practices for requirement specification
- Provide templates and examples used in real-world projects

This serves as a foundational reference for students, developers, and project teams aiming to build better, user-aligned software.

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a proposed software system.

It serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built. By thoroughly understanding what users need and expect, development teams can avoid costly misunderstandings, scope creep, and software that fails to meet user demands.

### 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarity of Goals:** It ensures the development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should do.
2. **Reduces Errors:** Clear requirements help reduce ambiguity and misunderstandings that can lead to development errors.
3. **Improved Planning:** Accurate requirements allow for better estimation of cost, time, and resources.
4. **Better Design:** Knowing user needs helps in designing an intuitive and functional system.
5. **Customer Satisfaction:** Meeting real user needs leads to a more useful and accepted product.

### 📈 Where It Fits in the SDLC

Requirement Analysis usually follows the project initiation phase and precedes system design. It forms the basis for creating design specifications, development plans, and test cases.

> Without solid requirement analysis, projects are more likely to fail due to misaligned expectations, poor planning, or lack of stakeholder engagement.
## 📌 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that help ensure a software project meets the needs of users and stakeholders. Each activity builds a strong foundation for successful design, development, and delivery.

### 🔍 1. Requirement Gathering
- Collecting information from stakeholders, clients, end-users, and business documents.
- Helps understand the problem domain and the needs of the target audience.
- Involves interviews, surveys, observations, and reviewing existing systems.

### 💬 2. Requirement Elicitation
- Actively engaging with stakeholders to uncover hidden needs and expectations.
- Goes beyond gathering by using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and workshops.
- Clarifies ambiguous or conflicting requirements.

### 📝 3. Requirement Documentation
- Organizing and recording gathered requirements in a clear and structured format.
- Documents include Software Requirement Specification (SRS), user stories, or use cases.
- Ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system should do.

### 🧠 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Evaluating and prioritizing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
- Creating models (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) to visualize requirements.
- Identifies dependencies and potential conflicts.

### ✅ 5. Requirement Validation
- Verifying that documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.
- Includes activities like walkthroughs, reviews, and formal inspections.
- Ensures requirements are testable and ready for implementation.

---

These activities help transform stakeholder needs into actionable, validated requirements, minimizing risks and setting the project up for success.
## 🧾 Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are typically categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential to define what the system must do and how it should behave.

---

### ✅ Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe the specific behavior, features, and functions that a system must perform. These define **what** the system should do.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users must be able to **search for available properties** based on location, price, and date.
- The system should allow users to **book a property** and receive confirmation.
- Admins should be able to **add, update, or delete property listings**.
- The system must support **user login and authentication**.
- The application should display a **booking summary** before confirming payment.

---

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements describe **how** the system performs certain operations. These include quality attributes like performance, security, usability, and reliability.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The platform must be **accessible on both desktop and mobile devices** (responsiveness).
- Pages should load within **3 seconds** under normal internet conditions (performance).
- The system must use **HTTPS encryption** to secure user data during transactions (security).
- The UI should follow a **clean and intuitive design** for better user experience (usability).
- The booking system should be able to handle **up to 10,000 simultaneous users** without crashing (scalability).

---

Clearly distinguishing between these two types of requirements ensures that the system is not only functional but also reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

## 🧩 Use Case Diagrams

### 📘 What is a Use Case Diagram?

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and a system. It shows the **functional requirements** of the system in terms of how users engage with its various features.

### 🎯 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Helps identify system boundaries and scope.
- Clarifies how different users interact with the system.
- Aids communication among stakeholders (developers, designers, clients).
- Lays a foundation for designing system features and user flows.

### 👥 Use Case Diagram for Booking System

Below is a use case diagram for a simplified **property booking system**, showing key interactions between different types of users and system functionality.

![Use Case Diagram](alx-booking-uc.png)

**Actors:**
- **User**: Searches and books properties.
- **Admin**: Manages property listings.
- **System**: Sends confirmations automatically.

**Key Use Cases:**
- Search Properties  
- View Property Details  
- Book Property  
- Make Payment  
- Manage Listings (Add, Edit, Delete)  
- View Bookings  
- Send Booking Confirmation


### 📘 What is Acceptance Criteria?

**Acceptance Criteria** are a set of conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by the end-user, client, or other stakeholders. These are written in clear, simple language and define the **boundaries of a user story or feature**, ensuring that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what “done” means.

---

### 🎯 Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

- Ensures that the requirements are **testable and verifiable**.
- Reduces ambiguity by clearly defining the **expected outcomes** of a feature.
- Serves as a **baseline for QA** and user acceptance testing.
- Helps the development team understand the **functional goals** before implementation.
- Improves communication between product owners, developers, and testers.

---

### 🧾 Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature

**Feature:** Checkout for Booking a Property

**User Story:**  
_As a user, I want to review my booking details and make a payment so that I can confirm my reservation._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The user must be able to select check-in and check-out dates.
- [ ] The system should display a booking summary including property name, dates, number of guests, and price breakdown.
- [ ] A “Confirm & Pay” button must be clearly visible.
- [ ] The system should validate all fields before allowing payment.
- [ ] The user must receive a confirmation message and email upon successful payment.
- [ ] If payment fails, an error message should be displayed and the user remains on the checkout page.

---

Acceptance criteria ensure that the **delivered functionality meets expectations** and can be accepted as complete by stakeholders. They play a critical role in bridging the gap between requirement analysis and actual development/testing.
