# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development. 

Requirement analysis is the critical first phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC), where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, documented, and analyzed. This ensures that the final product aligns with user goals and business objectives.

In this repository, we will:
- Define types of requirements (functional, non-functional, technical)
- Explore tools and techniques for gathering requirements
- Document best practices for requirement specification
- Provide templates and examples used in real-world projects

This serves as a foundational reference for students, developers, and project teams aiming to build better, user-aligned software.
